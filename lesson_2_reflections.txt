What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-It will create a .git 
-We do that so we can use commits 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-We can compare the differences between the most recent commit on the repository
with changes we just add to the staging area.
