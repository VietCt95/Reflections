When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you work on multiple computers or work on a project with some people. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because it will let us more control, and we can don't want to up some works that doesn't finish to github 
and let some people in our team continue that!
